      <h2>Soft Skills</h2>
      <p>
        In my academic career I had a chance to be a member of the teams, where
        we were working together on many different types of project. Most of
        them were focused on volunteer-social projects, science projects and
        cultural project. <br /> It was great chance to learn to work
        effectively under the pressure and to get better understanding of other
        people. It was great chance to develop my interpersonal and soft skills.
        My progress in this field gave me chance to managing and supporting my
        colleagues, what was great chance to test my soft skills. <br /> During
        my post academic experience I was traveling around the Europe getting to
        know many different great people and gaining experience in
        communication. My recent experience to work in customer service sector
        gave me the great chance to polish my soft skills in different role,
        what was great experience.
